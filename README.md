# ðŸ“„ SGD - Document Management System (Database Project)

This project consists of designing and implementing a **Document Management System (SGD)** for a company, supporting both traditional and digital communication. It was developed as part of the **Databases course** at Universidade LusÃ³fona (2024/2025), guided by professors JoÃ£o Caldeira and LuÃ­s Alexandre Gomes.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Goals

- Digitally manage the receipt, cataloging, classification, routing, and archiving of institutional documents.
- Handle multiple document types (e.g., invoices, certificates, memos) and their workflows.
- Ensure traceability of actions through system logs and notifications.
- Support process rules, deadlines, escalations, and conditional actions.
- Comply with normalization principles and relational database standards.

## ðŸ§± Project Structure

### ðŸ“Œ Phase 1 â€” Data Modeling

- âœ… **Entity identification** with descriptions
- âœ… **E-R Diagram** (Chen notation)
- âœ… **Relational model** (physical schema)
- âœ… **Normalization** up to 3NF
- âœ… **DDL SQL script** to create the database
- âœ… **Constraints** to enforce business rules

### ðŸ“Œ Phase 2 â€” Data Population and Queries

- âœ… **Static data** insertion (document types, users, organizational units, etc.)
- âœ… **Sample documents** with different states and workflows
- âœ… **Custom rules** for invoices and certificates
- âœ… **SQL SELECT statements** for:
  - Filtering by date, state, UO
  - Listing complete document workflows
  - Viewing logs and notifications

### ðŸ“Œ Phase 3 â€” Advanced Logic (Views, Functions, Procedures, Triggers)

- âœ… **Views**:
  - Archived documents
  - Recent documents (last 30 days)
  - Documents by type and department
- âœ… **Functions**:
  - Retrieve full history of a document
  - Get last known state
  - Count documents per state
- âœ… **Stored Procedures**:
  - List confidential documents
  - List current documents by department
  - Count historical actions
- âœ… **Triggers**:
  - Soft delete (flag hidden = true)
  - Logging changes automatically
  - Blockchain-like chaining of entries
